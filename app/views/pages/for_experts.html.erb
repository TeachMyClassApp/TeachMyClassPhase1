	<p class="text-center"> Teach My Class is a platform born from one teacher’s frustration. Teachers are experts in learning, but they need a village of experts to ensure students are getting the best hands-on experiences and up-to-date know-how. That’s where you come in. Spend an hour, a week – even an hour a week, in the classroom sharing your passion and your skills with the next generation of you. No more re-teaching at colleges, no more holes in the curriculum. The right expertise in the classroom, in real life. </p>
